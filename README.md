# fileReaderWPF

Have you ever wondered if there is some program that will just magically search your phrase in all of the folder files?  
Yeah me neither, but there it is the File Reader.

Just choose your extensions, select folder, write your phrase and off you go, no more opening of countless files in search of that
precious phrase.
